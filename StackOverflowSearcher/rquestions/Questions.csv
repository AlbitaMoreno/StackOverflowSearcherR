79709,NA,2008-09-17T03:39:16Z,3,Worse sin: side effects or passing massive objects?,"<p>I have a function inside a loop inside a function. The inner function acquires and stores a large vector of data in memory (as a global variable... I'm using ""R"" which is like ""S-Plus""). The loop loops through a long list of data to be acquired. The outer function starts the process and passes in the list of datasets to be acquired.</p>

<pre><code>for (dataset in list_of_datasets) {
  for (datachunk in dataset) {
    &lt;process datachunk&gt;
    &lt;store result? as vector? where?&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I programmed the inner function to store each dataset before moving to the next, so all the work of the outer function occurs as side effects on global variables... a big no-no. Is this better or worse than collecting and returning a giant, memory-hogging vector of vectors? Is there a superior third approach?</p>

<p>Would the answer change if I were storing the data vectors in a database rather than in memory? Ideally, I'd like to be able to terminate the function (or have it fail due to network timeouts) without losing all the information processed prior to termination.</p>

95007,15842,2008-09-18T17:59:19Z,56,Explain the quantile() function in R,"<p>I've been mystified by the R quantile function all day.  </p>

<p>I have an intuitive notion of how quantiles work, and an M.S. in stats, but boy oh boy, the documentation for it is confusing to me.  </p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q[i](p) = (1 - gamma) x[j] + gamma
  x[j+1],</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm with it so far.  For a type <em>i</em> quantile, it's an interpolation between x[j] and x [j+1], based on some mysterious constant <em>gamma</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= 9, (j-m)/n &lt;= p &lt;
  (j-m+1)/ n, x[j] is the jth order
  statistic, n is the sample size, and m
  is a constant determined by the sample
  quantile type. Here gamma depends on
  the fractional part of g = np+m-j. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how calculate j?   m?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the continuous sample quantile
  types (4 through 9), the sample
  quantiles can be obtained by linear
  interpolation between the kth order
  statistic and p(k): </p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - alpha) / (n - alpha - beta
  + 1),
  where α and β are constants determined
  by the type. Further, m = alpha + p(1
  - alpha - beta), and gamma = g.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I'm really lost.  p, which was a constant before, is now apparently a function.  </p>

<p>So for Type 7 quantiles, the default...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type 7</p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1). In this case, p(k) = mode[F(x[k])]. This is used by S. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone want to help me out?  In particular I'm confused by the notation of p being a function and a constant, what the heck <em>m</em> is, and now to calculate j for some particular <em>p</em>.  </p>

<p>I hope that based on the answers here, we can submit some revised documentation that better explains what is going on here.  </p>

But now I have another problem which I can't 'vectorize.' I know vectors are faster and loops slower, but I can't figure out how to do this in a vector method:</p>

<p>I have a data frame (which for sentimental reasons I like to call my.data) which I want to do a full marginal analysis on. I need to remove certain elements one at a time and 'value' the data frame then I need to do the iterating again by removing only the next element. Then do again... and again... The idea is to do a full marginal analysis on a subset of my data. Anyhow, I can't conceive of how to do this in a vector efficient way. </p>

<p>I've shortened the looping part of the code down and it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (j in my.data$item[my.data$fixed==0]) { # &lt;-- selects the items I want to loop 
                                            #     through
    my.data.it &lt;- my.data[my.data$item!= j,] # &lt;-- this kicks item j out of the list

551113,2056,2009-02-15T16:05:33Z,3,Writing a GUI for the BRCAPRO Cancer Gene Risk Calculation Engine,"<p>I think this is a completely unique question on Stack Overflow.  First some background:</p>

<p>I've been asked to write a new GUI on top of a calculation engine called BRCAPRO (brack-a-pro).  BRCAPRO implements a Mendelian computational model based on a piece of software called BayesMendel.  BRCAPRO calculation are used by doctors and surgeons specializing in cancer treatment to show patients:</p>

<ul>
<li>The probability of being diagnosed with cancer based on their genetics and family history.</li>
<li>The change in life expectancy based on different forms of treatment and/or the age at which these treatments are started.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've done enough research to know that the BRCAPRO formulas are far too complicated to reasonably implement in my own code.</p>

<p>There is an existing well-known (to cancer doctors) software package called CancerGene: <a href=""http://www8.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept47829/files/65844.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www8.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept47829/files/65844.html</a>.  This program is very old, runs on Windows 95 and includes calculating engines for several forms of cancer my client does not work with.  Ideally my client would like his application to run on the web so that he can share information with other doctors easily.</p>

<p>My task is take the CancerGene application, which is built on the BRCAPRO engine, and:</p>

<ol>
<li>Duplicate 90% of its functionality</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary functionality</li>
<li>Modify the output of reports</li>
<li>If possible, make it web-based</li>
</ol>

<p>Now my question:</p>

<p>Does anybody have any idea how to code against BRCAPRO?  I have Googled for two days and found no API documentation or development information of any kind.  Wikipedia says that the BayesMendel modeling software is written in R, but I don't have any idea what BRCAPRO is written in.  I know absolutely nothing about R.  </p>

<p>To be clear, I don't need to modify the behavior or calculating engine of BRCAPRO.  I just need to know how to feed it input so that it returns numbers to me.</p>

<p>--  Edit to add more information --</p>

<p>I downloaded the CancerGene application in the above link and installed it.  There was a small amount of documentation, including the data format that BRCAPRO expects to receive.  Without getting into an unnecessary level of detail, BRCAPRO expects matrix-formatted data where each column represents a genetic trait and each row represents a family member.  Now I just need to know how to pass this matrix to the BRCAPRO engine once I collect it from my Web/Windows form.</p>

<p>Here's hoping there are a couple of doctor/developers here on Stack Overflow!</p>

<p>How can I plot this data so that the bin is sorted from most negative on the left to most positive on the right? Currently my graph looks <a href=""http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcvdrfrh_5cm5qkchw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a>.  Notice that it is not sorted at all.  In particular the second bar (<code>value = 76</code>) is placed to the right of the first:</p>

<pre><code> (8.048,18.05] (-21.95,-11.95]
            81              76
</code></pre>

<p>This is the command I use to plot:</p>

<pre><code>barplot(x,ylab=""Number of Unique Tags"", xlab=""Expected - Observed"")

<p>They are character strings that look like: ""9:24 am"", ""12:35 pm"", and so forth. i am trying to calculate the duration of the interview based on these two. what is the best way of doing this?</p>

<p>i know that, for dates, there are lots of classes or functions like <code>as.date()</code>, <code>as.Date()</code>, <code>chron()</code>, or <code>as.POSIXct()</code>. So i was looking for something like <code>as.time()</code>, but could not find it. Should I just append a made-up date and convert the whole thing into a <code>POSIX()</code> date-time class, then use <code>difftime()</code>? </p>

<p>What is the best practice of handling time in R?</p>

They are similar and I have to do the same processing to each one, so I wrote a function that takes a data frame, processes it, and then returns a data frame. This works. But I am afraid that I am passing around a very big structure. I may be making temporary copies (am I?) This can't be efficient. What is the best way to avoid passing a data frame around? Thank you.</p>

659725,37751,2009-03-18T19:21:41Z,5,Column Stores: Comparing Column Based Databases,"<p>I've really been struggling to make SQL Server into something that, quite frankly, it will never be. I need a database engine for my analytical work. The DB needs to be fast and does NOT need all the logging and other overhead found in typical databases (SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, etc.) </p>

<p>Yesterday I listened to <a href=""http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4009.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Michael Stonebraker speak at the Money:Tech conference</a> and I kept thinking, ""I'm not really crazy. There IS a better way!"" He talks about using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS"" rel=""noreferrer"">column stores</a> instead of row oriented databases. I went to the Wikipedia page for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS"" rel=""noreferrer"">column stores</a> and I see a few open source projects (which I like) and a few commercial/open source projects (which I don't fully understand). </p>

<p>My question is this: In an applied analytical environment, how do the different column based DB's differ? How should I be thinking about them? Anyone have practical experience with multiple column based systems? Can I leverage my SQL experience with these DBs or am I going to have to learn a new language?</p>

<p>I am ultimately going to be pulling data into R for analysis. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I was requested for some clarification in what exactly I am trying to do. So, here's an example of what I would like to do:
Create a table that has 4 million rows and 20 columns (5 dims, 15 facts). Create 5 aggregation tables that calculate max, min, and average for each of the facts. Join those 5 aggregations back to the starting table. Now calculate the percent deviation from mean, percent deviation of min, and percent deviation from max for each row and add it to the original table. This table data does not get new rows each day, it gets TOTALLY replaced and the process is repeated. Heaven forbid if the process must be stopped. And the logs... ohhhhh the logs! :)</p>"
